I am a CIFAR AI Safety Post-doc Fellow, currently working with [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) at **Mila**, and [Prof. Sungjin Ahn](https://mlml.kaist.ac.kr/sungjinahn) and [Prof. Sungsoo Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home) at **KAIST**. I am also serving as an Academic Collaborator of [LawZero](https://lawzero.org/en/team), a non-profit organization focused on safe AI.

I work on fundamental challenges in machine learning, including **exploration** in reinforcement learning, **credit assignment** in long-horizon decision making, amortized **sampling & variational inference**, and **uncertainty quantification**, with a focus on their applications to **LLM/LMM** training and inference.

Beyond core ML research, I actively collaborate with domain experts across diverse fields, including **industrial engineering** (e.g., smart factories, transportation), **hardware engineering** (e.g., signal and power integrity), **drug discovery** (e.g., small-molecule generation and molecular dynamics), and **robot learning** (physical intelligence).

### Backgrounds

I got a Ph.D. at KAIST, under the guidance of [Prof. Jinkyoo Park](http://silab.kaist.ac.kr/our-team/).

During my Ph.D., I've had the privilege of collaborating with several professors and their research groups:

- I have been working with [Prof. Sungsoo Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home) on generative models for scientific discovery, including our joint efforts on GFlowNets with his student, [Hyosoon Jang](https://hsjang0.github.io/hsjang/).

- I have also engaged deeply with researchers at Mila, having physically visited [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/)'s group from December 2023 to May 2024. Throughout this period, I've been fortunate to collaborate with many talented researchers for GFlowNets, including [Emmanuel Bengio](https://folinoid.com/), [Nikolay Malkin](https://malkin1729.github.io/), [Seanie Lee](https://seanie12.github.io/), [Moksh Jain](https://mj10.github.io/), [Siddarth Venkatraman](https://hyperpotatoneo.github.io/), and [Dinghuai Zhang](https://zdhnarsil.github.io/), among others.

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I completed my master's degree under the supervision of [Prof. Joungho Kim](https://tera.kaist.ac.kr/), an expert in designing 3D ICs (e.g., HBM) for SI/PI performance.


#### My research at master prieods. 

One surprising fact about my background is that I worked in hardware system design and analysis from 2020 to 2022 during my master's degree. My focus was on signal integrity and power integrity in 2.5D/3D semiconductor architectures, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM) modules. I developed advanced deep learning algorithms to automate and optimize hardware layout design and device placement. These experiences provided me with a deep understanding of computing systems and HBM, which are crucial for AI computing, as well as practical knowledge in using deep learning methods for hardware optimization challenges.
