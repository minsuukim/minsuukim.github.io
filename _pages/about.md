I’m a Ph.D. Candidate in the Industrial and Systems Engineering department at KAIST, where I am advised by <a href="http://silab.kaist.ac.kr/our-team/">Prof. Jinkyoo Park</a>. I also closely collaborate with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home">Prof. Sungsoo Ahn</a>.

I'm visiting <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/">Prof. Yoshua Bengio</a>'s group at the Mila - Quebec AI Institute from 2023/11 to 2024/09 for collaborating GFlowNet research.

I'm eager to study and investigate machine learning methods for exploring discrete, combinatorial, structured space, which has challenging applications like drug discovery, computational biology, hardware design optimization, and combinatorial optimization.

Here are my current research interests:
- Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets)
- Amortized Inference using Diffusion Model
- Neural Combinatorial Optimization
- Machine Learning for Hardware Design Optimization
- Machine Learning for Drug Discovery
- Machine Learning for Computational Biology
