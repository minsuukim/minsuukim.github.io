*Note: Starting in March 2025, I will be joining <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/">Yoshua Bengio</a>'s group at the Mila - Quebec AI Institute as a postdoctoral researcher.*

I’m a Ph.D. candidate at KAIST, where I am advised by <a href="http://silab.kaist.ac.kr/our-team/">Jinkyoo Park</a>. I also have been closely collaborating with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home">Prof. Sungsoo Ahn</a>'s group at POSTECH since 2022.

I am working as a collaborative researcher at <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/">Yoshua Bengio</a>'s group at the Mila - Quebec AI Institute from October 2023 to February 2025. During this period, I have been fortunate to collaborate with many researchers such as <a href="https://folinoid.com/">Emmanuel Bengio</a>, <a href="https://malkin1729.github.io/">Nikolay Malkin</a>, <a href="https://seanie12.github.io/">Seanie Lee</a>, <a href="https://mj10.github.io/">Moksh Jain</a>, <a href="https://hyperpotatoneo.github.io/">Siddarth Venkatraman</a>, and <a href="https://zdhnarsil.github.io/">Dinghuai Zhang</a>, among many others.

I'm eager to study and investigate deep learning and machine learning methods (e.g., deep reinforcement learning, generative modelling, amortized inference) for exploring discrete, combinatorial, structured space. 

I'm interested in following topics of new learning algorithms:
- GFlowNets (e.g., *better exploration and credit assignments for GFlowNets*)
- Diffusion Models (e.g., *discrete diffusion and diffusion-based GFlowNets*)
- Deep Reinforcement Learning (e.g., *replay training for sample efficient DRL*)

My research applications includes:
- Drug discovery (*e.g., de novo discovery of small molecular graphs*)
- Computational biology (*e.g., DNA, RNA, and 3D antibody design*)
- Hardware design optimization (*e.g., Placement of decoupling capacitance, and channel routing*)
- Combinatorial optimization (*e.g., Vehicle routing, scheduling, and graph covering*).
- Alignment of large multimodal model (*Finetuning text-to-image model with human feedback*)
- Alignment of large language model (*e.g., Red-Teaming with safety tuning, RLHF, amortizing chain-of-thought*)
