*Note: Starting in March 2025, I will be joining <a href="https://mlml.kaist.ac.kr/pair">KAIST-Mila Prefrontal AI Research Center</a> jointly hosted by Prof. Yoshua Bengio, Prof. Sungjin Ahn, and Prof. Sungsoo Ahn as a postdoctoral researcher. I will applying GFlowNets for safe AI (with Yoshua Bengio), object centric learning (with Sungjin Ahn), and drug discovery (with Sungsoo Ahn).   

I’m a Ph.D. candidate at KAIST, where I am advised by <a href="http://silab.kaist.ac.kr/our-team/">Jinkyoo Park</a>. I also have been closely collaborating with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home">Sungsoo Ahn</a>'s group at POSTECH since 2022.

I am working as a collaborative researcher at <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/">Yoshua Bengio</a>'s group at the Mila - Quebec AI Institute from October 2023 to February 2025. During this period, I have been fortunate to collaborate with many researchers such as <a href="https://folinoid.com/">Emmanuel Bengio</a>, <a href="https://malkin1729.github.io/">Nikolay Malkin</a>, <a href="https://seanie12.github.io/">Seanie Lee</a>, <a href="https://mj10.github.io/">Moksh Jain</a>, <a href="https://hyperpotatoneo.github.io/">Siddarth Venkatraman</a>, and <a href="https://zdhnarsil.github.io/">Dinghuai Zhang</a>, among many others.

I'm currently focused on advancing reasoning in deep learning and its applications across various domains, including large language models and scientific discovery. My short-term research goals involve fine-tuning large models using Bayesian posterior inference, leveraging the off-policy amortized inference capabilities of GFlowNets. For my long-term research, I'm interested in System 2 deep learning, which entails developing world models that can measure uncertainty and represent causal relationships. I believe that such world models should also capture harmful risks and enable the creation of pessimistic agents to avoid misaligned actions, thereby guarantees safety.

Additionally, I have a keen interest in combinatorial optimization (CO) and NP-hard algorithmic problems. I often utilize deep learning methods to address these challenges or incorporate techniques from CO, such as local search and tree search, into deep learning. I believe that CO and NP-hard problems are closely related to reasoning in deep learning and System 2 deep learning, and I am eager to explore these connections further.

One surprising fact about my background is that I worked in hardware system design and analysis from 2020 to 2022 during my master's degree. My focus was on signal integrity and power integrity in 2.5D/3D semiconductor architectures, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM) modules. I developed advanced deep learning algorithms to automate and optimize hardware layout design and device placement. These experiences provided me with a deep understanding of computing systems and HBM, which are crucial for AI computing, as well as practical knowledge in using deep learning methods for hardware optimization challenges.

To sum up, my research methodology includes:
- GFlowNets (e.g., *better exploration and credit assignments for GFlowNets*)
- Diffusion Models (e.g., *discrete diffusion and Boltzmann generator*)
- Deep Reinforcement Learning (e.g., *replay training for sample efficient DRL*)

My research applications includes:
- Scientific discovery (*e.g., de novo discovery of small molecular graphs*)
- Hardware design optimization (*e.g., Placement of decoupling capacitance, and channel routing*)
- Combinatorial optimization (*e.g., Vehicle routing, scheduling, and graph covering*).
- Alignment of large multimodal model (*Finetuning text-to-image model with human feedback*)
- Alignment of large language model (*e.g., Red-Teaming with safety tuning, RLHF, amortizing chain-of-thought*)
