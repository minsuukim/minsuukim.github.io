I’m a Ph.D. candidate at KAIST, where I am advised by <a href="http://silab.kaist.ac.kr/our-team/">Prof. Jinkyoo Park</a>. I also have been closely collaborating with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home">Prof. Sungsoo Ahn</a>'s group at POSTECH since 2022.

I am a collaborative researcher at <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/">Prof. Yoshua Bengio</a>'s group at the Mila - Quebec AI Institute from October 2023 to February 2024. Starting in March 2024, I will be joining the group as a post-doctoral researcher.

I'm eager to study and investigate deep learning and machine learning methods (e.g., deep reinforcement learning, generative modelling, amortized inference) for exploring discrete, combinatorial, structured space. 

I'm interested in following topics of new learning algorithms:
- GFlowNets (e.g., *better exploration and credit assignments for GFlowNets*)
- Diffusion Models (e.g., *discrete diffusion and diffusion-based GFlowNets*)
- Deep Reinforcement Learning (e.g., *replay training for sample efficient DRL*)

My research applications includes:
- Drug discovery (*e.g., de novo discovery of small molecular graphs*)
- Computational biology (*e.g., DNA, RNA, and 3D Antibody design*)
- Hardware design optimization (*e.g., Placement of decoupling capacitance, and channel routing*)
- Combinatorial optimization (*e.g., Vehicle routing, scheduling, and graph covering*).
- Finetuning Large Multimodal Model (*Finetuning Text-to-Image Model with Human Feedback*)
- Safety alignment of large language model (*e.g., Probabilistic Red-Teaming, probabilistic RLHF*)
