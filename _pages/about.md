Hi!

I’m a Ph.D. Candidate in the Industrial and Systems Engineering department at KAIST where I am advised by <a href="http://silab.kaist.ac.kr/our-team/">Prof. Jinkyoo Park. I also closely collaborate with  <a href="https://sungsooahn.notion.site/">Prof.Sungsoo Ahn.


My research interest is mainly focused at the intersection of these areas:
- Deep Learning
  - Deep Reinforcement Learning
  - Symmetric Learning
  - Conditional Generation
- Combinatorial Optimization & Design with Deep Learning
  - Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs)
  - Bio Sequential Design
  - Molecular Generation & De novo design optimization
  - Hardware Design Optimization

Combinatorial optimization (CO) is very important, but most of the problems are NP-hard. Combinatorial (black-box) design problem is a high impact application of the CO, containing molecule generation, bio-design, and hardware design, but also has enormous search space & objective evaluation time

I believe deep learning can become an alternative method for combinatorial optimization & design, because a deep neural network is capable of exploring massive combinatorial space, is generalizable to several tasks, and is much faster than a conventional solver. Now, the still classical method gives more efficient performance than the deep learning method; I want to contribute to making AlphaGo for combinatorial optimization & design.
