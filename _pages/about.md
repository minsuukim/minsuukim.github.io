### Backgrounds

I got a Ph.D. at KAIST, under the guidance of [Prof. Jinkyoo Park](http://silab.kaist.ac.kr/our-team/).

During my Ph.D., I've had the privilege of collaborating with several esteemed professors and their research groups:

- I have been working with [Prof. Sungsoo Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home) on generative models for scientific discovery, including our joint efforts on GFlowNets with his student, [Hyosoon Jang](https://hsjang0.github.io/hsjang/).

- I have also engaged deeply with researchers at Mila, having physically visited [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/)'s group from December 2023 to May 2024. Throughout this period, I've been fortunate to collaborate with many talented researchers, including [Emmanuel Bengio](https://folinoid.com/), [Nikolay Malkin](https://malkin1729.github.io/), [Seanie Lee](https://seanie12.github.io/), [Moksh Jain](https://mj10.github.io/), [Siddarth Venkatraman](https://hyperpotatoneo.github.io/), and [Dinghuai Zhang](https://zdhnarsil.github.io/), among others.

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I completed my master's degree under the supervision of [Prof. Joungho Kim](https://tera.kaist.ac.kr/), an expert in designing 3D ICs (e.g., HBM) for SI/PI performance.

### Research statement

I am focused on advancing reasoning in deep learning, particularly in large language models and scientific discovery. My short-term research aims to fine-tune large models using Bayesian posterior inference, leveraging GFlowNets' off-policy amortized inference. Long-term, I'm interested in System 2 deep learning, developing world models that measure uncertainty, represent causal relationships, and support sequential reasoning for planning. These models should also identify risks, enabling the creation of safety-guaranteed pessimistic agents.

I'm also keen on combinatorial optimization (CO) and NP-hard problems, often integrating deep learning with CO techniques like local search and tree search. I see a strong link between these areas and System 2 deep learning, particularly in combinatorial reasoning, and I'm eager to explore this further.

#### Detailed research topics

My research methodology includes:
- GFlowNets (e.g., *better exploration and credit assignments for GFlowNets*)
- Diffusion Models (e.g., *discrete diffusion and Boltzmann generator*)
- Deep Reinforcement Learning (e.g., *replay training for sample efficient DRL*)

My research applications includes:
- Scientific discovery (*e.g., de novo discovery of small molecular graphs*)
- Hardware design optimization (*e.g., Placement of decoupling capacitance, and channel routing*)
- Combinatorial optimization (*e.g., Vehicle routing, scheduling, and graph covering*).
- Alignment of large multimodal model (*Finetuning text-to-image model with human feedback*)
- Alignment of large language model (*e.g., Red-Teaming with safety tuning, RLHF, amortizing chain-of-thought*)

#### My research at master prieods. 

One surprising fact about my background is that I worked in hardware system design and analysis from 2020 to 2022 during my master's degree. My focus was on signal integrity and power integrity in 2.5D/3D semiconductor architectures, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM) modules. I developed advanced deep learning algorithms to automate and optimize hardware layout design and device placement. These experiences provided me with a deep understanding of computing systems and HBM, which are crucial for AI computing, as well as practical knowledge in using deep learning methods for hardware optimization challenges.
