I'll be joining Microsoft's [Copilot Tuning Research team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/copilot-tuning-research/) as a Senior Researcher in early 2026. I will work on advancing the Copilot agent through research on LLM post-training, with a focus on reinforcement learning, agentic behavior, and reliable decision-making.


I currently **CIFAR AI Safety Post-doc Fellow**, currently working with [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) at **Mila**, and [Prof. Sungjin Ahn](https://mlml.kaist.ac.kr/sungjinahn) and [Prof. Sungsoo Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home) at **KAIST**. 

My research interests include improving sample efficiency and credit assignment in reinforcement learning, with applications to frontier large language models and AI safety.

### Backgrounds

I got a Ph.D. at KAIST, under the guidance of [Prof. Jinkyoo Park](http://silab.kaist.ac.kr/our-team/) where I worked on bridging reinforcement learning and combinatorial optimization, receiving the Presidential Best Ph.D. Thesis Award.

During my Ph.D., I collaborate with [Prof. Sungsoo Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home), and conducted extended research visits to **Mila** collaborating with [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) and his group on GFlowNet-related research.

I completed my master's degree under the supervision of [Prof. Joungho Kim](https://tera.kaist.ac.kr/), working on signal and power integrity in 2.5D/3D semiconductor systems (including HBM) using deep learning–based optimization methods.
